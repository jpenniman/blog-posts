During a severe thunderstorm one night, your building loses power.  The once thought to be defunct generator mounted to the roof just above your data center detects the outage and make its attempt to start up.  The neglected equipment catches fire and burns a sizeable hole in the roof.  The torrential rains pour into the building for hours.  You rush into the office after receiving a frantic phone call only to find your server room flooded.  Water drips from every server, switch, router, and appliance in your racks.

Sounds far fetched, but it's a true story.  This actually happened.  Disaster Recovery is about more than just performing a nightly backup.  If this, or other disaster, happens to you, are you prepared?  Can you have your company up and running in the downtime window provided?
